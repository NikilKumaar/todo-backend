# Simple Todo List App (MERN Stack)

## Description

This is a simple Todo List application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks with an intuitive interface and a robust backend.

### Features:
- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks and set a description.
- **View Tasks**: Display a list of all tasks with their status.
- **Update Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
  
The app demonstrates full-stack development, connecting a React frontend to an Express API server, which interacts with a MongoDB database for persistent storage.

### Technologies Used:
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store todo items.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js to handle API routes.
- **React**: Frontend library to build the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to run the server-side logic.
